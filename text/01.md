#### Foundation Topics

#### Preparing to Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux

##### What is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Server?

When you pay for RHEL, Red Hat offers you a supported Enterprise Linux operating system, with the following key features:
* Monitored updates and patches that have gone through a thorough testing procedure.
* Different levels of support and help, depending on which type of subscription you have purchased.
* A certified operating system that is guaranteed to run and to be supported on specific hardware models.
* A certified platform for running enterprise applications such as SAP middleware, Oracle Database, and many more.
* Access to the Red Hat Customer Portal at https://access.redhat.com, where you can find much detailed documentation that is available to customers only.

##### Getting the Software

##### _Using Red Hat Enterprise Linux_

The easiest way to use all the different programs, tools, and services that Red Hat offers, is to sign up for the developer program.

The most important things you can get in the official RHEL8 Server release is access to the Red Hat Customer Portal.

##### _Using CentOS_

CentOS is the Community Enterprise Operating System. 

CentOS started as a recompiled version of RHEL, with all items that were not available for free removed.

In 2014, Red Hat incorporated CentOS.

##### _Other Distributions_

Scientific Linux has been continued.

Red Hat uses Fedora as the development platform for RHEL.

The result is that Fedora offers access to the latest software, which in most cases is much more recent than the thoroughly tested software components of RHEL.

Never use Fedora to study for RHCSA.

##### Understanding Access to Repositories

If you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux with a subscription, you will need to use the Subscription Manager software to get access to repositories.

##### Setup Requirements

RHEL 8 can be installed on physical and virtual hardware.

The following conditions must be met:
* 1 GiB of RAM
* A 10-GiB hard disk
* A network card

The following requirements are recommended:
* 64-bit platform support
* 2 GiB of RAM
* A 20 GiB hard disk
* A DVD drive, either virtual or physical
* A network card

##### Cert Guide Environment Description

Using VirtualBox or VMWare allows users to record _snapshots_ and then revert to the snapshot at a later time.

#### Performing a Manual Installation

The most command installation starts from the installation DVD or, when working in a virtual environment, from the installations DVD ISO file.

**Step 1** After booting from DVD, you'll see different options:
* **Install CentOS 8.0.0** Normal installation.
* **Test This Media & Install CentOS 8.0.0** Test the installation media. Takes forever.
* **Troubleshooting** Troubleshooting options.

**Step 2** To start a normal installation, select **Install CentOS 8.0.0**.

**Step 3** From the _Welcome to CentOS_ screen, select language and keyboard settings.

**Step 4** Installation Summary screen, with the following options:
* **Keyboard**
* **Language Support**
* **Time & Date**
* **Installation Source** Specifies where to install from.
* **Software Selection**
* **Installation Destination** Identifies to which disk(s) to copy the files during installation.
* **KDUMP** Creates a core dump if anything goes wrong.
* **Network & Host Name** Sets IP address and related settings.
* **Security Policy** Offers a limited set of security policies, enabling you to harden a server.
* **System Purpose** 

**Step 5** Select **Keyboard** options.

**Step 6** The Language Support option may already be configured.

**Step 7** The **Time & Date** configuration should display a map. You may specify the NTP (Network Time Protocol) if network is accessible.

**Step 8** In Software section, you may check out the Installation Summary. For exam, you will not have to specify URL where additional packages are available. They should be available.

**Step 9** The base environment is common. Install with **Server with GUI** option.

**Step 10** For all the exercises in course, you cannot use the default partitioning. Use the LVM (Logical Volume Manager) partitioning. Do this using the **Custom** button. The recommended settings are as follows:
* /boot mounted on an XFS-formatted traditional partition, size 500 MiB
* an XFS-formatted logical volume with size of 10-GiB  that is mount on /
* a 1 GiB logical volume that is used as swap space

**Step 11** Click **Network & Host Name** to set up networking. Make sure to switch network connection to _On_. 

**Step 12** The Security Policy option enables you to tighten security on your server. Currently, the PCI-DSS and OSPP options are supported.

**Step 13** Enables you to specify what you're using your server for.

**Step 14** Click **Begin Installation** to start the installation.

**Step 15** Click **Root Password** first and set the password to **password**. This is not secure but by using a simple password, you'll avoid later installation issues.

**Step 16** Click **User Creation** to create a user. 

**Step 17** Click **Reboot** when done to restart the PC and finalize the installation.

**Step 18** Accept the license agreement. Then click **Finish the Configuration** and **Done** to complete.

#### Review Questions

1. You do not want to buy an RHEL license, but you want to create an environment to practice for the exam. Which distributions should you use?
2. What happens to the network configuration if you don't specify anything during the installation?
3. You want to install a minimal system. How much RAM do you need?
4. Why is it a good idea to have Internet access on all servers you are installing?
5. You want to install a virtual machine on a computer that does not have an optical disk drive. What is the easiest alternative to perform the installation?
6. Why is it a good idea to install a GUI?
7. What is the default file system on RHEL 8?
8. Can you install RHEL if you do not have Internet access?
9. What is the most important feature offered through RHN?
10. Which installation pattern should you use if you have a very limited amount of disk space available?

#### End-of-Chapter Lab

Repeat the procedure "Performing a Manual Installation" to install one more server. Ensure the following conditions are met:
* Use the server names server1 and server2.
* Set the network configuration to obtain an IP address automatically.
* Make sure to keep at least 1 GiB of disk space as unallocated disk space (which is not assigned to any partition) so that you have free space to work on the partitioning exercises in later chapters.
* Install one server using the Minimal Install patter and the other server using the Server with GUI installation pattern.
