#### Foundation Topics

#### Working on Local Consoles

Highlight the differences between the terms _console_ and _terminal_.

A _console_ is the environment that a user is looking at.

A _terminal_ is an environment that is opened on the console and that provides access to a text shell, which is the command-line environment that can be used to type commands. 

A _terminal_ can be offered through a window while using a graphical console, but it can also be opened as the only thing a user sees in a textual console.

In a textual environment, _console_ and _terminal_ are more or less equivalent.

In a graphical environment, _console_ and _environment_ are not identical.

A user may have multiple terminals open on a console, but a user may not have multiple consoles open in one terminal.

##### Logging In to a Local Console

Roughly there are two ways to make yourself known to a Linux server:
1. Log in from the prompt that is presented.
2. A remote connection is established.

Reasons to login as a non-root user:
1. More difficult to make critical errors.
2. On most occasions, user does not need root permissions.
3. Forces attacker to guess name of that user, password of that user, and root password.
4. User may use **su -** to gain root privileges.
5. Use **sudo** to configure specific administration tasks.

##### Switching Between Terminal in a Graphical Environment

##### Working with Multiple Terminals in a Nongraphical Environment

See **COMMAND** **chvt**.

**Alt-F1** Gives access to the GNOME Display Manager graphical login.
**Alt-F2** Provides access to the current graphical console.
**Alt-F3** Gives access back to the current graphical session.
**Alt-F4 thru F6** Gives access to non-graphical consoles.

##### Understanding Pseudo Terminal Devices

Every terminal used in a Linux environment has a device file associated with it.

For terminal windows that are started from a graphical environment, pseudo terminals are started. These pseudo terminals are referred to using numbers in the **/dev/pts** directory.

##### Booting, Rebooting, and Shutting Down Services

For an experienced Linux administrator, rebooting a server is rarely necessary. 

However, there are some scenarios in which a reboot is necessary:
1. Recover from serious problems such as server hangs and kernel panics.
2. Apply kernel updates.
3. Apply changes to kernel modules that are being used currently and therefore cannot be reloaded easily.

To issue a proper reboot, the **systemd** process must be alerted.

The difference between **systemctl halt** and **systemctl poweroff** commands is hat **systemctl poweroff** talks to power management on the machine to shut off power on the machine. This often does not happen when using **systemctl halt**.

#### Using SSH and Related Utilities

Many administrators work with servers that are not physically accessible.

In SSH, cryptography is used to ensure that a user can be assured to be connecting to an intended server.

Also, traffic is encrypted while transmitted.

##### Accessing Remote Systems Using SSH

To access a server using SSH, two components are needed:
1. On the remote server, the **sshd** service should be running and offering services at port 22 and it should not be blocked at the firewall.
2. 

If you want to access Linux servers through SSH from a Windows computer, you need to install an SSH client like PuTTY on Windows.

Accessing another Linux machine from a Linux terminal is relatively simple. Just use command **ssh** followed by the name of the other Linux machine.

If a user wants to connect with a user account other than the his / her current one, the user may specify the name of the user on the command line like user@server format. 

After connecting to the remote server, a public key fingerprint is stored in the file **~/.ssh/known_hosts**. 

If the remote host key fingerprint does not match the key fingerprint that is stored locally, perhaps the the known server has moved IP addresses. If so, remove the key fingerprint from the **~/.ssh/known_hosts** file on the client PC. 

##### Using Graphical Applications in an SSH Environment

There are two requirements for starting graphical applications through an SSH connection:
1. An X server must be running on the client computer. The X server is the software component that creates the graphical screens.
2. The remote host must be allowed to display screens on the local computer.

The easiest way to allow the remote host to display graphical screens on yoru computer is by adding the **-Y** option to the **ssh** command.

**Option** | **Use**
------ | -------
**-v** | Verbose; shows in detail what is happening while establishing the connection
**-Y** | Enables support for graphical applications
**-p \<port>** | Used to connect to an SSH service that is not listening on default port 22

As an administrator, you may create a systemwide configuration that allows you to use _X forwarding_ which is starting graphical applications through an SSH session. To do so, open **/etc/ssh/ssh_config** and make sure it includes the following line:

```sh
ForwardX11 yes
```

##### Securely Transferring Files Between Systems

If a host is running the **sshd** service, that service can also be used to securely transfer files between systems.

##### _Using scp to Securely Copy Files_

The **scp** command is similar to **cp** command, which is used to copy local files, but it also includes an option that enables it to work with remote hosts.

##### _Using sftp to Securely Transfer Files_

The **sftp** command provides an alternative to securely transfer files.

**sftp** should be considered as an alternative.

With **sftp** the only requirement on the remote server is that it should be running the **sshd** service.

From the FTP client session, you use typical FTP client options, like **put** to upload and **get** to download a file.

With **sftp**, the local directory is important.

##### _Using rsync to Synchronize Files_

The **rsync** command uses SSH to synchronize files between a remote directory and a local directory.

A delta sync is a synchronization in which only changes are processes for synchonization.

**Option** | **Use**
------- | -------
**-r** | Synchronizes the entire directory tree
**-l** | Also synchronizes symbolic links
**-p** | Preserves symbolic links
**-n** | Performs only a dry run, not actually synchronizing anything
**-a** | Uses archive mode, thus ensuring that entire subdirectory trees and all file properties will be synchronized
**-A** | Uses archive mode, and in addition synchronizes ACLs
**-X** | Synchronizes SELinux context as well

##### Configuring Key-Based Authentication for SSH

If SSH is used on the Internet, it might not be a good idea to allow password logins.

The only thing necessary to enable key-based login is to create a key-pair - everything else is organized by default.

The private key should be kept private and never distributed.

The public key is stored in the home directory of the target user on the SSH server in the file **.shh/authorized_keys**.

When authenticating using key pairs, the user generates a hash derived from the private key. This hash is sent to the server, and if on the server it proves to match the public key that is stored on the server, the user is authenticated.

##### Using Passphrases or Not?

For maximal security, use a passphrase when setting up the public-private key pair.

For convenience, within a trust environment, just press Enter twice through the setup to create a key pair without a passphrase.

To create a key pair, use the **ssh-keygen** command.

The **ssh-copy-id** command is used to copy the publick key over to the target server.

**~/.ssh/authorized_keys** is the file on the remote host in which the public key is stored.

##### Using the screen Command

The **screen** command is not covered on the RHCSA exam.

The **screen** command enables users to open multiple terminal sessions, even if you are not in a graphical session.

It also allows a user to share a session with other users.

**screen** must be installed with **yum install -y screen**.

You can start a task that takes a long time from a screen session, detach from it, and attach to it later. The command continues running.

**screen** procedure:
1. Open an SSH session.
2. From the SSH session type **screen** to open a screen session.
3. Start whichever task you want to start and keep it running.
4. Use the Ctrl-A, D key sequence to detach from the screen session and log out from the SSH session.
5. When you are ready to reconnect, start the SSH session again. It is essential that you are using the same user account that you used before.
6. Attach to the screen session using **screen -r**. You may not conveniently finish the work you started from the screen session before.

You can also use **screen** to work together with other users in the same session:
1. Make sure both users are using SSH to connect to the system on which you want to work together. Both users must use the same user account when using SSH to connect. 
2. One user needs to start a screen session using the **screen** command.
3. The second user can just connect to the screen session using **screen -x**.
