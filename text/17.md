#### Foundation Topics

#### Managing Systemd Targets

Items other than services are started with Systemd.

This chapter looks at how Systemd targets are used to boot a system into a specific state.

##### Understanding Systemd Targets

A Systemd _target_ is basically just a group of units that belong together.

Isolatable targets contain everything a system needs to boot or change its current state.

Four targets that can be used while booting:
* **emergency.target** Only a minimal number of units are started, just enough to fix a broken system
* **rescue.target** Starts all units required to get a fully operational Linux system but does not start nonessential services.
* **multi-user.target** Often used as the default target a system starts in and commonly used on servers.
* **graphical.target** Also commonly used. Starts with all units needed for full functionality and a graphical interface.

##### _Working with Targets_

Three common tasks of working with targets:
* Adding units to be automatically started.
* Setting a default target.
* Running a nondefault target to enter troubleshooting mode.

##### _Understanding Target Units_

Configuration of targets consists of two parts:
* the target unit file
* the "wants" directory, which contains references to all unit files that need to be loaded when entering a specific target

Targets by themselves can have dependencies to other targets.

A target unit defines its requirements and which services and other targets it cannot coexist with. It also define loading ordering by using the **After** statement in the [Unit] section.

##### _Understanding Wants_

Wants in Systemd define which units Systemd wants when starting a specific target. 

Wants are created when Systemd units are enabled using **systemctl enable** and this happen by creating a symbolic link in the /etc/systemd/system directory.

##### _Managing Systemd Targets_

Use **systemctl enable** and **systemctl disable** commands to start services at boot.

You do not have to keep up with specific target a service must be started in. This information is stored in the service unit file.

Procedure for enabling a service:
1. Type **systemctl status vsftpd**.
2. Type **ls /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants**. You'll see symbolic links taking care of starting the different services.
3. Type **systemctl enable vsftpd**. Command creates a symbolic link for file /usr/lib/systemd/system/vsftpd.service to the directory /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants.

Exam tip: enable all required services at once.

##### _Isolating Targets_

On Systemd machines, there are several targets.

A target is a collection of units.

By isolating a target, you start the target with its dependencies.

Type **systemctl --type=target** to see a list of all targets currently loaded. This list shows only active targets. Use **systemctl --type=target --all** for an overview of all targets on the computer.

Of all the targets, a few are important because they can be started (isolated) to determine the state of the server. 

**targets** | **runlevels**
-------|-------
poweroff.target | runlevel 0
rescue.target | runlevel 1
multi-user.target | runlevel 3
graphical.target | runlevel 5
reboot.target | runlevel 6


##### _Setting the Default Target_

Type **systemctl get-default** to see current default target and use **systemctl set-default** to set desired default target.

For the graphical.target, make sure required packages are installed. Use **yum group list** to look through RPM packages groups for "server with gui" and "GNOME Desktop" packages. Use **yum group install "server with gui"** to install required GUI packages.

#### Working with GRUB 2

This section explains how to apply modifications to the GRUB 2 boot loader configuration.

##### Understanding GRUB 2

The GRUB 2 boot loader is installed in the boot sector of the server's hard drive and is configured to load a Linux kernel and initramfs.

Normally GRUB 2 works just fine.

If you need to apply changes, the starting point is the /etc/default/grub file.

For the RHCSA exam, make sure to understand the /etc/default/grub file.

There are also some configuration files in /etc/grub.d. You typically do not have to modify these.

##### Understanding GRUB 2 Configuration Files

If system is a BIOS system, name of GRUB 2 configuration file is /boot/grub2/grub.cf.

On an UEFI system, the file is /boot/efi/EFI/redhat.

Do _not_ edit this configuration file. It is automatically generated.

##### Modifying Default GRUB 2 Boot Options

GRUB 2 modifications typically happen in /etc/default/grub.

The most important line in  this file is GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX, which defines how the Linux kernel should be started. Some like candidates for removal from this line is **rhgb** and **quiet**. On the exam, it would probably be a good idea to remove these.

GRUB_TIMEOUT defines the amount of time the server waits for you to access the GRUB 2 boot menu before it continues.

Type **man 7 bootparam** for a man page that contains descriptions of all boot parameters.

Use command **grub2-mkconfig** to modify the grub configuration. See **COMMANDS**.
